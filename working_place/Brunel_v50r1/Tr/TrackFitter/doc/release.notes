 - Remove TrackFitter_load.cpp

!=========================== TrackFitter v2r12 2006-12-18 ===================
! 2006-12-15 - Gerhard Raven
 - use the projector selector tool to obtain the relevant projector
   instead of using the master projector

!=========================== TrackFitter v2r11 2006-11-28 ===================
! 2006-11-28 - Eduardo Rodrigues
 - std::ostringstream messaging corrected to please valgrind: tracks should
   not be assumed to always be part of a container

! 2006-11-22 - Jeroen van Tilburg
 - TrackKalmanFilter: Adapted to new State naming conventions in FitNode.
   Introduced FitUpstream job-option which must be consistent with the one
   in TrackMasterFitter.

! 2006-11-21 - Marco Cattaneo
 - Fix propagation of error return status of biSmooth() step in TrackKalmanFilter
 - use gsl_pow_2 instead of pow(x,2.) in TrackMasterFitter

!=========================== TrackFitter v2r10 2006-11-02 ===================
! 2006-11-02 - Jeroen VAN TILBURG
 - Added job option flag "UnbiasedResiduals" to calculate the unbiased
   residuals. Default is false.
 - Fixed small decrease in efficiency for match tracks: the prediction and
   smoother step in the bidirectional fit are not applied for the first node.

! 2006-10-20 - Jeroen VAN TILBURG
 - Calculate unbiased residual in bidirectional smoother step.
 - Propagate changed in TrackEvent and TrackFitEvent. Clean up code.

!=========================== TrackFitter v2r9 2006-10-18 ====================
! 2006-10-18 - Jeroen VAN TILBURG
 - Bug fix: residuals were not updated in smoothing step of bi-directional fit.
   This bug affects the final chi2 of the track and the outlier removal.

! 2006-10-11 - Marco Cattaneo
 - Clean up warning messages

! 2006-10-10 M Needham
 - Correct state at first measurement on backward tracks

! 2006-10-07 Eduardo Rodrigues
 - fixed inconsistency in option name (for case-sensitive options parser)

!=========================== TrackFitter v2r8 2006-09-21 ====================
! 2006-09-21 - Jeroen VAN TILBURG
 - Using the reference state for extrapolating. This improves the dp/p
   resolution for forward tracks. References states are close enough to the
   true trajectory such that one call to the extrapolators is sufficient.

 - Improved calculation of noise matrix in predictReverseFit(). Mathematically
   this is now the correct way of calculating the reverse noise. Fast
   bidirectional fit (storeTransport=true) is now (almost) as good as slow one.

!=========================== TrackFitter v2r7 2006-08-03 ====================
! 2006-08-02 Eduardo Rodrigues
 - bi-directional fit by default
 - reference information now set by default (uses by default the tool
   for long tracks)
 - Maximum 2 outliers removed by default
 - using the pre-defined z-positions related to state locations from the
   new file StateParameters.h instead of old plain option

!=========================== TrackFitter v2r6 2006-07-27 ====================
! 2006-07-27 - Eduardo Rodrigues
 - Options "StatesAtMeasZPos" and "ZPositions" exclusive
 - state at first measurement always saved
 - code simplifications
 - removal of outliers again off until consequences are fully tested

! 2006-07-27 - Marco Cattaneo
 - More cleanups of Warnings
 - Get units from GaudiKernel/SystemOfUnits.h

! 2006-07-26 - Eduardo Rodrigues
 - switch back on the removal of outliers (max 5 allowed by default)
 - track fit set as failed when not possible to determine all the requested
   states on a track
 - setting of states at measurements z-positions (when requested) handled
   correctly when outliers are removed
 - clean-up of unnecessary methods/code
 - improved debug/warning/error messages, for clarity

!=========================== TrackFitter v2r5 2006-06-30 ====================
! 2006-06-23 - Jeroen Van Tilburg 
 - Improved the bidirectional fit in TrackKalmanFilter. Re-use of transport 
   parameters in the reverse direction. Store the predicted state from the
   reverse fit.

!=========================== TrackFitter v2r4 2006-06-20 ====================
! 2006-06-20 - Eduardo Rodrigues
 - propagation of changes from TrackEvent
 - renaming in TrackMasterFitter option for consistency with private tool
   instance name: TrackNodeFitterName becomes NodeFitter

! 2006-06-20 M Needham
 - minor bug fix 

! 2006-06-19 - Jeroen Van Tilburg
 - Added bidirectional fit to the TrackKalmanFilter. It can be turned on by
   a joboption: BiDirectionalFit.

! 2006-06-15 - Jeroen van Tilburg
 - Remove check on z before extrapolation so that the transport matrix is
  initialized correctly.
 - Moved the setting of the transport matrix to before the if statement, such
  that it is set also when the transport parameters are not reused.

! 2006-06-15 - Gerhard Raven
 - Change matrix manipulations to benefit from making the projection Matrix
   a 1x5 matrix instead of a vector; remove related hacks that are no longer
   needed (TrackVectorProd)
 - change dynamic_cast to FitNode such that when it fails we get a 
   'bad cast' exception instead of a SEGV due to a 0-pointer dereference

! 2006-06-14 - Jeroen van Tilburg
 - Changed meaning of NumberFitIterations: iterations of the fit without
   outliers removal. Only the reference vectors are updated.
 - Added joboption MaxNumberOutliers (set to 0) to determine how many outliers
   are maximally allowed to be removed.

! 2006-06-14 - Eduardo Rodrigues
 - fixed bug in using the tool to set reference info to fitter
 - added new option in TrackMasterFitter for dealing with reference info tool

! 2006-06-12 M. Needham
 - Add possibility to set reference information to fitter

! 2006-06-06 - Eduardo Rodrigues
 - removed explicit 5-dimension number from code
 - migration to Gaudi::Units
 - no z-check when adding state closest to beam-line
 - TracksOutContainer option in TrackEventFitter set to same as input
   by default (no more need to set it explicitly for default config.)

! 2006-05-02 - Eduardo Rodrigues
 - propagation of the renaming of the Track Event Model typedefs
   (in TrackTypes.h in Kernel/LHCbDefinitions)

!=========================== TrackFitter v2r1 2006-04-19 ====================
! 2006-04-19 - Jeroen van Tilburg
 - TrackKalmanFilter: introduced temporary vector in predict method. Needed
   since SMatrix inlines the actual calculation.

! 2006-04-18 - Jeroen van Tilburg
 - TrackKalmanFilter: use new transportIsSet method.

! 2006-04-12 - Jeroen van Tilburg
 - TrackKalmanFilter: Replace Place_at with operator equal assignment. 
 - TrackKalmanFilter: Fix the return type for TrackVectorProd method.

   the node it is also removed from the track (needed for consistency)

!=========================== TrackFitter v2r0 2006-02-13 ====================
! 2006-02-08 - Eduardo Rodrigues
 - migration to LHCb v20r0
 - Geant3/Geant4 units conversions for matrix inversions done via the new
   TrackUnitsConverters.h file in TrackEvent
 - sorting of states removed as done automatically in Track class

!=========================== TrackFitter v1r1 2006-01-27 ====================
! 2006-01-20 - Eduardo Rodrigues
 - TrackKalmanFilter: tools made private -> possible to run 2 instances
   of the fitter with, say, different projectors

! 2006-01-17 - Jeroen van Tilburg
 - Added the required initialisation of GaudiTool in TrackMasterFitter.cpp and
   TrackKalmanFilter.cpp.
 - TrackMasterFitter.cpp: use looseTolerance to compare states at z-positions.

!=========================== TrackFitter v1r0 2005-11-28 ====================
! 2005-11-28 - Eduardo Rodrigues
 - minor cosmetics

! 2005-11-21 - Jeroen van Tilburg
 Many changes. Main modifications:
 - Split the TrackKalmanFilter tool into a TrackMasterFitter tool and a
   TrackKalmanFilter tool. The latter fits a track starting from FitNodes
   (one iteration). The former takes care of outlier removal, refitting,
   states at predefined z-positions.
 - Added the FitNodes to the Track (Track still has a vector of Nodes).
 - Added Location-enum to the predefined z positions.
 - Cleaned up the debug statements.
 - Corrected bug: state at beam line was not added to the track.

! 2005-10-25 - Eduardo Rodrigues
 - TrackEventFitter and TrackKalmanFilter cope with both upstream and
   downstream fitting (only downstream fitting possible before)
 - buglet corrected in dealing with residual errors
